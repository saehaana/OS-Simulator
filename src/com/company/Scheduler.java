/**Uses Round Robin scheduling algorithm:
 * Will be given time quantum of q = 4
 * First task will execute for one time quantum,
 * First task then preempted and next task in queue will execute for one time quantum; repeat
 * If task completes execution before time quantum finishes, then move onto next task in queue and give one time quantum**/

Summary

This is a semester long project where students are to simulate an operating system by means of a program. Done in any language of choosing, the operating system simulator was worked on in three phases and consisted of four main components.

Phase 1 - Process Management:

Phase 2 - Memory Management:

Phase 3 - Bonus and GUI:

How To Run

The OS simulator was created using IntelliJ IDE and as of right now there is no executable. So the only way to run the program is to save all files to a folder and execute Main.java from within the IDE. One thing to note is the inclusion of the BufferedReader class to read text from specified templates/program files. Your version of the OS simulator will not run correctly if you do not change the file paths of the templates to your download's directory. If you do not change the file path directory, BufferedReader will not be able to read correctly and therefore processes and their associated operations cannot be properly set.
